# color-detection-in-image-and-video
Implemented in python3.8. The aim is to get the RGB value of a color when clicked on the uploaded image.<br>
For that part check out this <a href='https://collegestoree.wordpress.com/2020/08/03/developer-its-a-change-request/'>link</a>.<br>
OpenCv, Numpy and Pandas are used for implementation and a csv file with the values of RGB.
An improvement to this project was implementing it to a live stream, enabling it to detect primary Red, Blue and Green 
colors from a live stream through a mobile. Successfully implemented and to read something about, 
can be found on this link. Basically it recognizes the colors from a live stream and gives an alert sound when conditions are met.
